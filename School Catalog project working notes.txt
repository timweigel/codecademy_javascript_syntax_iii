In this project I'll create a parent class School with three child classes. The parent and child classes will have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:
	- School
		- Properties: 
			- name (string)
			- level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high')
			- numberOfStudents (number)
		- Getters: all properties have getters
		- Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
		- Methods: 
			- .quickFacts() 
			- .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)

	- Primary
		- Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
		- Properties: 
			- pickupPolicy (string)

	- Middle
		- Does not include any additional properties or methods

	- High
		- Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
		- Properties: 
			- sportsTeams (array of strings)
