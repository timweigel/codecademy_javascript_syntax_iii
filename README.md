# codecademy_javascript_syntax_iii
 This is a repository for my Codecademy Learn JavaScript Syntax, Part III code that I want to share. As with my other Codecademy repositories, this module is part of the Back-End Engineer track as it exists at a particular point in time - February 2021 in this case - so if you're seeing this after that it may no longer match up. If you're seeing this BEFORE then, please be in touch as I wouldn't mind some lottery numbers or stock tips.

The lesson breakdown does not necessarily correspond with the content of the standalone JavaScript courses, so please keep that in mind if you found this looking for ideas about those lessons.

I'm making this repository public so people can find it if they'd like to see what I've come up with for the various projects as part of the course.

I generally hew pretty close to the instructions, but sometimes I'll put a little something different in. I'll comment what I'm up to and why.
