In this project you will create a parent class named Media with three subclasses: Book, Movie, and CD. These three subclasses have the following properties and methods:

Book
Properties: author (string), title (string), pages (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty).
Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()

Movie
Properties: director (string), title (string), runTime (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty)
Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()

CD
Properties: artist (string), title (string), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty), songs (array of strings)
Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()

==========
Common properties for Media parent class:
	- All subclasses have:
		- Properties:
			- title
			- isCheckedOut
			- ratings
		- Methods:
			- getAverageRating()
			- toggleCheckOutStatus()
			- addRating()
			
Computing average rating: sum all the values, divide by length. :)

The Codecademy solution for the average rating is to use a reducer, but it 
was just as easy for me to do this with a forEach() command as well.

I will rewrite it with a reducer function for practice as well.

==========
Challenge activities:
"If you would like to continue working on this project, we have listed some avenues to build on your existing progress.

	- Add more properties to each class (movieCast, songTitles, etc.)
	- Create a CD class that extends Media. (did already as part of the initial implementation)
	- In .addRating(), make sure input is between 1 and 5. (done)
	- Create a method called shuffle for the CD class. The method returns a randomly sorted array of all the songs in the songs property.
	- Create class called Catalog that holds all of the Media items in our library."

Tests:

Book:
const historyOfEverything = new Book('Bill Bryson', 'A Short History of Everything', 544);
historyOfEverything.toggleCheckoutStatus();
console.log(historyOfEverything.isCheckedOut);
historyOfEverything.addRating(4);
historyOfEverything.addRating(5);
historyOfEverything.addRating(5);
console.log(historyOfEverything.getAverageRating());

Movie:
const speed = new Movie('Jan de Bont', 'Speed', 116);
speed.toggleCheckoutStatus();
console.log(speed.isCheckedOut);
speed.addRating(1);
speed.addRating(1);
speed.addRating(5);
console.log(speed.getAverageRating());
